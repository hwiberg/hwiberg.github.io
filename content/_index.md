          Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and Operations Research
          at Carnegie Mellon University's [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu). My research leverages optimization and machine learning techniques in healthcare. I develop novel approaches to enable data-driven decision making, including prescriptive frameworks and interpretable methods. In parallel, I have collaborated extensively with clinical collaborators on projects spanning oncology, pediatric trauma, and [COVID-19](https://covidanalytics.io).

          I completed my PhD at the Operations Research Center at MIT, working with [Professor Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). I spent a year after graduation as an ML/OR researcher at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com), and previously worked at [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/) as a healthcare data scientist.
