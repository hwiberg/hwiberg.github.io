          Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and Operations Research
          at Carnegie Mellon University's [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu). I am affiliated with the the [CMU-NIST AI Measurement Science & Engineering Cooperative Research Center (AIMSEC)](https://www.cmu.edu/aimsec/index.html) and [Block Center for Technology and Society](https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/index.html).
          

          My research leverages optimization and machine learning to improve healthcare in both clinical and operational settings. I am particularly interested in the use of ML/OR to broaden healthcare access and improve patient outcomes, and the responsible development and deployment of such tools in practice. I am motivated by real-world problems identified with clinical collaborators, spanning oncology, transplantation, pediatric trauma, and COVID-19. My work involves methodological development and applied modeling to devise generalizable solutions to these problems.


          I completed my PhD at the Operations Research Center at MIT, working with [Professor Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). I previously worked as an ML/OR researcher at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com) and Data Scientist at [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/).
