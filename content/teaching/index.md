- **The Analytics Edge in Healthcare**: We recently published a new textbook, [The Analytics Edge in Healthcare](https://www.dynamic-ideas.com/books/the-analytics-edge-in-healthcare), co-authored with Dimitris Bertsimas and Agni Orfanoudaki. This book aims to bridge the gap between OR/OM research and healthcare implementation by bringing predictive and prescriptive analytics into clinical training and practice. If you are interested in teaching healthcare analytics to medical practitioners and administrators, please [reach out](mailto:hwiberg@andrew.cmu.edu)!
